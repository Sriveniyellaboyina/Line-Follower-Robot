# 🚗 Line Follower Robot using Arduino

## 📌 Project Description
This project is a **Line Follower Robot** built using **Arduino UNO** and **IR sensors**.  
The robot is programmed to follow a black line on a white surface (or vice versa) by continuously reading sensor inputs and controlling the motors accordingly.  
It demonstrates the concepts of **embedded systems, robotics, and automation**.

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. **IR sensors** detect the contrast between the line (black) and the background (white).  
2. If the left sensor detects the line → robot turns left.  
3. If the right sensor detects the line → robot turns right.  
4. If both sensors detect white (background) → robot moves forward.  
5. If both sensors detect black (line) → robot stops or continues straight (depending on logic).
